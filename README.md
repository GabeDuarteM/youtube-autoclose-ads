## The problem

Current ad-blockers completly removes all sorts of advertisements on youtube, making the video creator not get any money with monetization at all.
This is bad, because they are working on a content for out entertainment without getting anything from us.

At the same time, nobody likes viewing ads, and when you are chilling on the sofa and that 3min advertisement starts to play, anyone would dislike to stand up and go there to manually close it.

## This solution

This extension allows ads to play and run freely on youtube, but after a certain amount of time (we default to 5 seconds), we automatically close them, just like a normal human would. This creates a balance between allowing the content creator to get monetization out of the content they make, and providing a good experience to the user watching the platform.

## Installation

This extension is available on the [Chrome Webstore][package].

1. Go to the [Chrome Webstore][package]
2. Click `Install`
3. ...
4. Profit

## Usage

To use the extension, just install it and go watch some videos. It will start closing the ads 5 seconds after the closing/skipping button is visible.

The amount of time the extension will wait before closed/skipped the ad can be changed by going to `More (the three dot icon beside the address bar) > More tools > Extensions`, and clicking on `Settings`. There you will be able to set the amount of time for both video ads and the normal ones.

## Other Solutions

I'm not aware of any, if you are please [make a pull request][prs] and add it here!
