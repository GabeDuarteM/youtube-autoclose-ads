## Download
This extension is available on the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-autoclose-ads/mppjhhbajcciljocgbadbhbgphjfdmhj).

## Why not just use a normal ad-block?

An ad-block completly removes all sorts of ads on youtube, making the video creator not get any money with monetization. 
This extension allow you to set a minimum time in which the ad will be displayed, and after that time, the ad will be closed automatically, allowing the content creator to get monetization on the video.
